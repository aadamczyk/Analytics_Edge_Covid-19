NYTimes Data
  - Cases: Only includes confirmed cases from federal, state, territorial or local government agency. EXCEPTIONS: Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia are only "probable" cases. Idaho our cases number is only lab-confirmed cases, but deaths include deaths of "probable" cases.
  - Dates: cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths as reported that day in that county or state
  - Counties: 
  
       NY - all 5 counties (New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond counties) are assigned to "New York City". Note a large jump in the number of deaths on April 6th due to switching from data from New York City to data from New York state for deaths.
       
       Georgia - Starting April 12th, our case count excludes cases labeled by the state as "Non-Georgia Resident" leading to a one day drop in cases. These cases were previously included as cases with "Unknown" county.
       
      Alabama - April 17th contained an error in reporting of lab test results that the state is working to correct.
