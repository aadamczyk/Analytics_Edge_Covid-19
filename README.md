NYTimes Data
  - Cases: Only includes confirmed cases from federal, state, territorial or local government agency. EXCEPTIONS: Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia are only "probable" cases. Idaho our cases number is only lab-confirmed cases, but deaths include deaths of "probable" cases.
  - Dates: cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths as reported that day in that county or state
  - Counties:

       NY - all 5 counties (New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx and Richmond counties) are assigned to "New York City". Note a large jump in the number of deaths on April 6th due to switching from data from New York City to data from New York state for deaths.

       Georgia - Starting April 12th, our case count excludes cases labeled by the state as "Non-Georgia Resident" leading to a one day drop in cases. These cases were previously included as cases with "Unknown" county.

      Alabama - April 17th contained an error in reporting of lab test results that the state is working to correct.

      Kansas City, Mo. - Four counties (Cass, Clay, Jackson and Platte) overlap the municipality of Kansas City, Mo. The cases and deaths that we show for these four counties are only for the portions exclusive of Kansas City. Cases and deaths for Kansas City are reported as their own line.
